The challenge binary was built on a recent Debian unstable (at 2023/04/11). Toolchain version doesn't matter as we use the one downloaded by gclient. V8 is built with default flags generated by gm.py. We use V8 11.4.73, which should be recent enough to have no public exploits.

### How

Follow the instructions at https://v8.dev/docs/build, checkout the source code, switch to the tag 11.4.73, do `gclient sync`, then apply the two patch with `git am`. Then just do as the instructions say.

Copy `out/x64.release/d8` and `out/x64.release/snapshot_blob.bin` to `bin/`.

After that, run `make all` to build the container image. Run `make pack` to pack for shipping.
